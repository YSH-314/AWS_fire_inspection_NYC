# Project Aim

The project aims to develop an AWS-based solution to analyze and gain insights into fire certifications and real estate sale prices across the five boroughs of New York City. By leveraging AWS services, such as Glue for data transformation, Athena for querying data in Amazon S3, and RDS for data warehousing, we seek to provide a comprehensive analysis that can inform various stakeholders, including government agencies, real estate professionals, and urban planners, about trends and patterns in fire certifications and property transactions. Through this solution, users will be able to explore correlations between fire safety inspections, certificate of fitness statuses, and property sale prices, contributing to informed decision-making and enhancing public safety measures in the city.
